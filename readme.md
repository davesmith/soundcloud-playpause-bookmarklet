#Soundcloud Play/Pause Bookmarklet
A bookmarklet to add convenient play/pause controls to [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com). I'm sure controls like this will be added to their awesome website some day, but until then here's a bookmarklet or two to play with

##The Bookmarklets
See the [Home Page](http://www.dave-smith.info/soundcloud-playpause-bookmarklet/1/) to this project to get at and add the bookmarklets. Anyone know how to add bookmarklets here?
