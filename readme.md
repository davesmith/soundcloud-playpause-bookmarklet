#Soundcloud Play/Pause Bookmarklet
A bookmarklet to add a convenient play/pause to [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com). One day they'll add play controls to their awesome website, but until then this plugs the gap

##The Bookmarklets
See the [Home Page](http://www.dave-smith.info/soundcloud-playpause-bookmarklet/1/) to this project to get at and add the bookmarklets. Anyone know how to add bookmarklets here?
